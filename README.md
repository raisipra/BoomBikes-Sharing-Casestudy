# Project Name
    BoomBikes Sharing Casestudy using Linear Regression
# Problem Statement
    - A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

    - A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

    - In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

    - we have to construct a model for boombike shared demand with available independent variables . it will use by company management team to understand how demand is vary with different feature. they according to manipulate their business demand strategy to fullfill their demand estimate. model will help to understand business model and manage according to their expectation.

    - Dataset using in this model : - day.csv file
# Business Goal:
    - You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.



## Conclusions
- top affecting features for the bike demand are
    1. temperature
    2. weather situation
    3. year
- Apart from these they should also take care for month in which demand increase or decrease most influencing month is sep,
also they should keep in mind about other features like day (sun), season(winter), season (summer) they have possitive coffiecent good demand in these season etc
We can observe that demand for bikes got increased in 2019 when compared to previous year 2018. This might be due to bike sharing system is gaining popularity year by year.
